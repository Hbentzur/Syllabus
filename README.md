# Open Source Studio

Open Source Studio is a class about maintaining an inclusive, healthy open source project. The first half of the semester will cover a variety of aspects related to community, project management, and technical material for open source projects. Students will complete weekly  exercises around contributing to open source. The second half of the semester will transition to a "studio" style course. Students will work together and propose a contribution to an open source project or develop their own project. We'll use a broad definition for "open source" project with an emphasis on documentation and collaboration. Guest speakers will visit the class in person or via video to talk about their experience maintaining an open source project.

## Expectations
* There will be a weekly homework assignment weeks 1 to 6. For each assignment
   * Complete a short technical exercise.
   * Complete the readings.
   * Write a reflection on the exercise and readings in the form of a blog post (or equivalent).
* Weeks 7-8, you will be expected to create a project proposal in the form of a blog post (or equivalent). This should include:
   * Summary of project idea.
   * Bios of contributors.
   * Proposed timeline.
   * Proposed mentors or advisors (more to come about this).
* Weeks 9-13 will focus on developing the project.
* Week 14 you will be expected to present your final project and complete a written reflection. See below for more details.
