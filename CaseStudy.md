# Open Source "Case Study"

On the first day of class, students will be placed into groups of 2. Each group will be scheduled for a "case study" presentation about an open source project of their choosing (some suggestions below and if you are struggling, I am happy to assign one to you.) Each case study should consist of an in-class presentation and write-up (in the form of a blog or medium post). Case study presentations should be 15-20 minutes with 5-10 minutes of questions and discussion. They should include research on the following:

## Case Study Questions

* Describe what the project is. Does it have a missions statement?
* Describe the history of the project -- when / how did it start? Has it grown? 
* Who are the contributors to the project?
* Describe the project's funding. Is it funded? What kinds of support does it get?
* Describe the project's community. Are there separate developer / user communities? Where are the primary places they interact?
* Does the project have a Code of Conduct? What does it consist of? If it does not, why?
* Does the project have a license? Why was the license chosen?
* Evaluate the project's approach to equity, diversity, and inclusion in its community.
* Is the project still active? Why or why not?
* What is the future of the project?
